Make sure to be clear in the final project what exactly you are testing (i.e., explain how your analysis tests for the stationarity, and what the underlying assumptions are). ","1":"From where are you getting date on prepared food? How is this related to inflation? Have you thought about the link between these? Do you have any reason think that this sector in particular is related to inflation? Has the UK gone through periods of high inflation? To test, perhaps compare across countries that see and do not see high inflationary periods? What kind of visualizations are possible?   ","2":"This seems like a good question to use panel data techniques. Literacy is not the only thing that is different between Europe and Asian countries, for example, corruption is likely much higher, wages are lower, there is more inequality, etc. How can you tell what is being caused by literacy rather than other factors. Can you look at interventions that increased literacy (like the advent of programs targeted at increasing literacy). Can you look at the local level? Where are you getting the voter turn out data? Seems like a good project for geographic visualizations. ","3":"You could probably expand considerably to world data (unfortunately, I guess). Where are you getting infection data? If you do go with a more global approach, you could look see if stock markets react more to local data (i.e., do infections in Asia effect NYSE, or in new York affect the shanghai se?) Were are you getting the stock market data? Seems like you can use good time series visualizations (infections across time, stock market across time with temporal indicators for covid events) and geographic visualizations (where are the infections popping up). Interesting to see what happens now that things are more in control in China.","4":"How can you disentangle what causes what? It could be that populism causes economic problems or the other way around. Could you use global economic indicators (so that they are not directly related to German political decisions) as the independent variable? Can you break this apart by region? That would allow for some nice geo-visualizations. Also, it would be nice to see a plot of the different parties on a 2D political scale (with one axis social and one axis economic and the scales running from conservative to liberal).","5":"I like this. Creating a success metric is interesting. However, spending itself is a factor of how much money the team has, right?, which is related to how much they have won in the past. Can you look at deviations from past behavior? How do teams differ after years where they were successful or not so much? ","6":"Do not use excel to clean your data. Use python directly (if the data comes in XLS format, import it with pandas, and make sure everything is replicable). What kind of model do you have in mind? What is the independent variable? In other words how do you incorporate the war as an aspect of your statistical model? I am not sure how a regression can show how much oil prices increases, that seems just like 2 numbers (final price minus initial price). Can you analyze the effect of oil volatility on other economic sectors? What was the role of OPEC? What kind of visualizations can you use here? ","7":"Be careful erasing missing values---a missing credit score might in and of itself be a signal about the credit history (who keeps it a secret?). This might be a good project to try and use some machine learning techniques (which might be a little outside the course, but easily findable on the web). What kin of visualizations can you use here? ","8":"Is there a difference between summer and winter sports and economics? I would imagine so, but this might also be because colder climates correlate with higher GDP. How does this compare in countries that saw rapid changes in GDP (such as Singapore?). What kind of visualizations can you do with this data? Why can you only find Olympic data through 2008? Did the financial crash have any effect on Olympic results since it hit some countries harder than others?","9":"A quick note: GDP\\/capita and PPP are not the same thing. In general, this project seems okay, but perhaps a bit simple. Where are you getting the data? What kind of visualization does this question lend itself to? GDP is correlated with many other factors, such as education, corruption, literacy? Can you figure out which of these factors is the most important---perhaps using principal component analysis?","10":"Where is the data on crime coming from? Try to figure out which direction causality is running, by using some kind of change in policy? For example, was there a period where extra police or something changed the crime rate without (directly) affecting the housing prices. Did Brexit have a change, since it probably changes house prices. This seems to lend itself nicely to geo-coded visualizations. Are postcodes which are on the boundary Richmond affected by the neighboring boroughs\' crime rates?","11":"I do not think there is any doubt that there is a relationship, so maybe dig deeper into what the relationship is. For example, is there a difference in the effect when western v Asian infections change? Is the effect being mitigated by public announcements of quarantine (you can find when various countries started their quarantines). This seems like a good project for data acquisition and geo-visualizations. Can you try to calculate the per-infection cost to the market? Why the Nasdaq rather than other exchanges?","12":"The stock market is not a good measure of regional economic activity since it is pretty global. Perhaps you could look at different sectors? Or look at the location that a company is incorporated in (this would also be a good web scraping exercise). I do not think there is any doubt covid is hurting the economy, so maybe dig deeper into what the relationship is. For example, is there a difference in the effect when western v Asian infection rates change? Is the effect being mitigated by public announcements of quarantine (you can find when various countries started their quarantines). ","13":"Seems like a good project with plenty of opportunity for data acquisition and visualizations. Try to figure out which direction causality is running, by using some kind of change in policy? For example, was there a period where extra police or something changed the crime rate without (directly) affecting the housing prices. Did Brexit have a change, since it probably changes house prices. Are postcodes which are on the boundary of boroughs affected by the neighboring crime rates?","14":"Seems like a good project with plenty of opportunity for data acquisition. Can you get regional car sales? Are you going to consider other types of electric vehicles? Where is the fuel price and quantity data coming from? Oil prices are a crude measure of how much petrol\\/gasoline gets sold, since it is also used for many  other things. The price of oil is also subject to many intricacies of geopolitics. Can you control for this? Perhaps price of petrol per gallon divided by oil price show the markup on auto fuel? ","15":"Can you get regional car sales, as this seems critical to evaluate the role of superchargers? Are you going to consider other types of electric vehicles? Where is the fuel price and quantity data coming from? There is also a causality issue, since clearly, if more people are using electric cars there will be more demand for charging stations. How can you get around this? What kind of visualizations are possible here? ","16":"Seems like a good project with plenty of opportunity for data acquisition and visualizations. Try to figure out which direction causality is running, since wealthier areas might have less property\\/violent crime if wealthier people commit less of it. Perhaps you can look at some kind of change in policy? For example, was there a period where extra police or something changed the crime rate without (directly) affecting the housing prices. Did Brexit have a change, since it probably changes house prices. Are postcodes which are on the boundary of boroughs affected by the neighboring crime rates?","17":"I am a little bit confused about what the question is? What is volatility on election day; does that mean changes on that day? Do you have real time data or only daily? Perhaps a more general (but nonetheless concrete) question is the effect of political uncertainty on asset volatility? This seems like a reasonable question that could be answered by looking at polling before an election (as a measure of uncertainty---the closer to 50%, the less predictable the outcome) and volatility. Also, looking at asset changes by sector after elections and who got into power (are democrats good for solar panels and republicans good for oil, etc.). As an aside I think the strength of the US economy is more complex than the strength of the dollar as a currency. ","18":"A quick note: GDP\\/capita and PPP are not the same thing. PPP takes into account how much stuff costs. In general, this project seems okay, but perhaps a bit simple. Why log GDP? What kind of visualization does this question lend itself to? GDP is correlated with many factors, can you figure out which of these factors is the most important---perhaps using principal component analysis? It could be that wealth allows for better education or that education allows people to get wealthier. How can you tell which is which? Can you use policies that changed education (like for example if a country increased its minimum schooling requirements, or made university less expensive, etc.)","19":"This question needs to be rethought out. First, a recession, being a period of economics contraction, will without a doubt cause a decline in stock prices. This is not so much a hypothesis as a tautology. Second, there is only 1 data point (since there was only one great recession) so its not clear what a statistical model would even look like. I fear that the question you pose is answered with nothing more than looking at a stock market graph. Perhaps a more specific question could be helpful: which sectors see more contraction during a recession. Some companies are going to be hit harder than other (i.e., construction in the us in 2008 which was closely tied to house prices) and some might eventer grow (there are countercyclical industries). By getting cross sectional data, coding the stocks by sector, you could look at the differences across sectors. Perhaps looking at other recessions as well (2001, right now, etc.). ","20":"This is a fine question, although I would think a little more about what kind of data visualizations and statistical relationships you can show. Perhaps think about the related question: when macroeconomic markets change which types of property markets are affected: did the devaluation of the point following Brexit hurt or help property values, was this effect constant or did it depend on if the property was in London or not, was high or low value, was a house v a flat etc. Same goes for recessions: did 2008 effect all property values more or less equally or did it skew a particular way? I would also consider interest rates and the value of the currency.","21":"Too many members; please resubmit","22":"This is a fine question, but you need to think more about where you will get the data and how this data can be used. I am not sure what statistical model you have in mind, what is the OLS? Perhaps you want to create a model that predicts pollution based on country characteristics (population, climate, etc.) and then see if the coefficients change before and after the policy? Seems like you could do some nice geographic visualizations. ","23":"This is a fine question, but you need to think more about where you will get the data and how this data can be used. What is the relation between financial data and the sugar tax? What kind of consumption data can you get on soda (fizzy drinks) can you get, where is this coming from? Are you looking at how soda companies (coke, etc.) faired in the face of the new tax? Perhaps also look at health outcomes. What kind of visualizations can you make? I think difference in difference is the right approach, once you work out the rest of the questions.","24":"Where are you getting the data? What kind of visualization does this question lend itself to? It seems obvious that higher income countries have longer life expectancies. GDP is correlated with many other factors, such as education, corruption, literacy; so I like the idea of trying to figure out which of these factors is the most important---perhaps using principal component analysis?","25":"This is a good question and has lots of potential. One worry I have is that the Twitter API is very limited unless you pay for a premium version (I think you can only look backwards 2 weeks or something like that). If you can pay, or figure out a way around this (web scraping perhaps) then I am all for it. Seems to be some good opportunities for data cleaning, combining the datasets, and plotting results.","26":"This is a nice question with some potential for good visualizations and statistical models. The basic question is straightforward, so perhaps also look at (i) how country travel restrictions matter (ii) where airline routes are going, for example, the difference between European based and Asian based airlines. Can you scrape the covid data? Which airlines are you using? Where does the financial data come from (stock prices?).","27":"This is a really cool question. What kind of data is the flight path information. I fear that it might be difficult to interpret flight paths and connect this to individual property values, but perhaps if they are geo-coded in a smart way this could be straightforward. The project has lots of opportunity for cool spatial visualizations. Can you use the proposed (and failed, I think) new runway to get some additional variation).","28":"I do not understand this proposal and what PPP has to do with companies using travel as an incentive. These seem like different ideas being jammed together. My advice would be to look at the effect of currency fluctuations on tourism, specifically how UK tourist changed (or did not change) their destinations in the face of the pounds massive devaluation following Brexit. Getting data on tourist destinations before and after seems to be straightforward, then you could look if destinations changed. In particular, did destinations with lower relative costs (weaker currencies) become more attractive as tourists became relatively poorer."}}
