You need to think carefully about what data you can actually access. Do you plan to use Airbnb data using their API? I think this would be a good way forward but it might be tricky. I encourage you to look into this (i.e., where you will get data) immediately. If you cannot access historical data from Airbnb what is your backup plan? You have lots of different questions and data in your proposal---I think you likely need to focus somewhat on a more narrow question. Comparing the incidence of covid and airbnb prices is a good specific question, but I doubt you will have the time or data to adequately address other components such as the effect on other industries. You need to clearly state your hypothesis: it is obvious that hotel booking declined, so what is the question? How much? For how long? Was it geographically determined? by infection rate? by government mandate of closure? Did rates increase when infections declined? What was the economic impact. Think more about what kind of visualization and statistical analysis you could do.", "2": "This is an interesting and unique question. What is your idea for WHY there is a relationship between military spending and interest rate. Is it a direct government spending mechanism or something that specifically has to do with military spending? I like the idea of plotting demand and supply curves, but am wondering the demand and supply of what exactly. My macro econ is a bit shaky, so do you see this as a direct implication of interest rate or a more roundabout \'general equilibrium\' effect? Why would the effect vary across countries, and why should you look at cross country data? Is military expenditure correlated with other economic fundamentals? What time periods are you looking at? In general, I think the project is feasible and data regarding both military expenditure and interest rates are widely available but I worry slightly about what exactly you are looking for, or what the \'model\' you have in your head and perhaps it would be helpful to try and discuss what the theoretical relationship between the variables.", "3": "This is a reasonable and tangible, if somewhat generic, question. As you point out, the main limitation is that literacy rates, birth rate, etc both determine GDP but also are determined themselves by the wealth of the country. In other words, there is a cyclic causal structure, so a regression is not necessarily a good tool. IV regression is possible, but I am not sure what IV\'s you could use---if you have any ideas this would be a great route. Otherwise, the standard would be to find natural experiments like policy changes that have a large effect on the \'independent variable\' is a semi exogenous way. Towards this, look up the difference-in-difference framework. This is not too difficult and could use some of the pandas and stats tools we went over in class. Use the world bank API (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898581-api-basic-call-structures) to acquire your data, as this is a good place to show off some skills. Seems like you could include some good data visualizations. You could look into principal component analyisis. ", "4": "Good question and sounds like you have a good idea of what you want to do. Data seems reasonable and attainable. We already spoke about some of the details but I might add that an interesting additional factor to consider is free v lease hold. Project seems ripe for some good geo-spatial visualizations. Question: are you getting all your data from the same source? Where is the housing price data coming from? You could use the zillow API: https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm or zoopla", "5": "Cool question. I think you have a good plan and a reasonable data set. One worry I have is that bitcoin prices seem to be driven by speculative trade and specifically by popular sentiment. So things like high profile tweets about bitcoin can dramatically change the price. Perhaps you could model this (it may also not be evidence against the EMH, as much as a source of information or coordination device among investors). Moreover, bitcoin is not really seen as an asset per-se but rather as a currency---tough I am not sure how this relates to your analysis. I like the idea of using google trends (or twitter or something) as a proxy for demand / relevance of bitcoin. I would also keep and eye on things like electricity prices and computing power as this has a direct effect on the mining of new bitcoins and hence the supply.", "6": "Wow, great data. My suggestion is to narrow in on a particular question/hypothesis. Perhaps: do complaints originating in lower income zip-codes get handled slower or less carefully? Do complaints increase during recessions? Do complaints have any geographic or time trends or trends by industry? Any of these kinds of questions would let you get at something more specific, and would lend itself both to statistical analysis and also interesting visualizations (in fact, in the link you provided they have a nice visualization of the US states and rates of complaints). Can you see if there is a correlation between a company\'s value / growth relative to competitors in the industry and their handling of complaints?", "7": "The data looks really good, and has a nice format. My concert is regarding causality: lots of things other than a shift towards renewable energy has occurred in the UK since 2014. So looking at the correlation between renewable energy and GDP will not be that informative---whatever effect you see on GDP might be coming from brexit, covid, or whatever else. Can you get data at the city level? If so, it would be very good to look at how the proportion of renewables in a given city relates to its economic growth over the time period (because you would be looking at the city level you will have many more observations to increase variation and reduce the noise created by national level variance). Perhaps it is also possible to look at government programs (hence quasi-exogenous variation) on investing in or promoting green energy. Looking at the time before and after the policy change could help work towards making causal claims. Look up difference-in-difference.", "8": "Cool question. I think you have a good plan and a reasonable data set. One worry I have is that bitcoin prices seem to be driven by speculative trade and specifically by popular sentiment. So things like high profile tweets about bitcoin can dramatically change the price: perhaps you could model this also and look for events that have an outsized effect on bitcoin price. I would also keep and eye on things like electricity prices and computing power as this has a direct effect on the mining of new bitcoins and hence the supply. Can you see what kind of transactions are bitcoins being used for (i.e, mostly fiat currency, good, services, etc) Does the price of other cryptocurrencies matter?", "9": "Cool question. I worry a bit about how easy it is to use the Reddit API. Have you tried it out? Perhaps it is actually simple. Also, can you look more broadly at other stocks as well. GME is somewhat of an anomaly but perhaps there are similar trends with recent \'hyped\' stocks such as TLSA, and more broadly other tech stocks that have a large public presence? Does online comments precede or follow trading activity? In other words, can such comments be used as a predictor of stock trends or are they a reaction to it. Perhaps it is too ambitious but it would be great to look at a list of the top 100 highest volume stocks and see how often they are mentioned on Reddit. I suppose there is actually only a very select set of stocks that get mentioned (tech stocks and other name brands). Is this predictive of performance?", "10": "I like the question and the data and project seem feasible and interesting. It would be interesting to see if you can find more geographically specific mental health data--for instance by post-code or neighborhood. This would give you a much better sense of where the relationship between the variables is since it would give you more variation and you could exploit geographic boundaries (for example, living in brent on the border of westminster might be a very different experience than living in brent on the border of harrow. Also, since you have the data, it would be interesting to see the effect of the economy generally on mental health, how much have recessions, brexit, covid etc had an impact.", "11": "Interesting question. It sounds like you have a good plan for getting and analyzing the data. The world bank has an API that you can use and which would be a good way to show off some of the tools we used in class. Will you have data about the types of properties? Does economic growth differentially impact different types of homes? For example, in London there has been a long term trend in converting homes into\\u00a0 multiple smaller flats. Does growth in a particular industry matter?\\u00a0 Also, how did brexit and covid affect this? How is predicted growth calculated? Can you find other measures of predicted growth that substantiate your measure? Can you run your model on the data from 2008-2018 and see if it can predict the values for 2019? That would be a good way to test your model?", "12": "I have to say I am very sceptical of your hypothesis (although this does not mean it\'s a bad question). There seems to be an abundance of evidence that life expectancy is highly correlated with income over large time scales. Reading the cited paper I see that the author also finds \\"evidence that the unfavorable health effects of temporary upturns are partially or fully offset if the economic growth is long-lasting\\" so it seems that the mechanism he proposes is that during recession people eat and smoke less and exercise more (although even this I find dubious). Thus, perhaps a good question would be to try and further investigate this. Look at behavior health traits such as diet, smoking and exercise and see how these correlate with economic growth. Note that cross country comparisons might not be apt here, since it is well established that wealthier countries will have, on average, a longer life expectancy (some outliers notwithstanding). Therefore, perhaps you could look at the US or UK and get data on individual diet and exercise and see how this is affected by the current state of the economy.", "13": "This is a reasonable question but I encourage you to think a bit more about the analysis. In particular, the UK has gotten richer (i.e., per capital GDP has increased) since 1995 and also there has been a push towards green energy, but it\'s not so clear there is a causal link. It could be that the threat of climate change forces a movement towards green energy independently of the economic effect, it could be that the investment in green technology directly causes economic growth, etc. Try to think of a way of disentangling these different possibilities? Can you look at the effect on electricity production (by input type) during recessions or booms? Can you look across different countries that have different economic profiles but over the same time period? Can you identify causes of external variation such as EU or other multi-national regulations that would increase the investment in renewable energy. The world bank has an API which is a good way to show off some of the tools we learned in the semester.", "14": "Cool (if somewhat simple) question and seemingly reasonable data. Does AIRBNB have an API from which you get the data? This would be a good way to show off the tools from class. The project also lends itself to some nice geospatial visualizations. You could use principal component analysis to find the most important factors in determining price. You could do text analysis to see which words get used in the description of high value rentals (sunny, spacious, etc). How have brexit, covid, etc changed the values of rentals. Do you have historical data? Can you look at how the density of airbnb rentals has changed the value of nearby hotels?", "15": "Looks like a feasible and interesting question. You seem to have a good plan for the data acquisition. I would try to investigate the changes in a detailed way, since intuition suggests that people wanted to move out of high density areas: so, city housing values might have declined but rural housing values may have increased. Can you also look across municipal lines that had different lockdown rules (for instance on the scottish or welsh border, or even across national borders in the EU). This might help explain why you see an effect if lockdown prohibits people from looking for new houses. I would also look more broadly at economic indicators, as it could be that a looming recession or economic uncertainty dissuades people from looking for larger or more expensive houses. Is there a different effect in the housing and rental markets? Does the type of accommodation matter (house v flat)?", "16": "Cool question. I worry a bit about how easy it is to use the Twitter API. Have you tried it out? In past years students had trouble accessing tweets more than a few days old. Perhaps you could also look at the reddit API. Some questions: Does online comments/tweets precede or follow trading activity? In other words, can tweets be used as a predictor of stock trends or are they a reaction to it. It would be great to look at a list of the top 100 highest volume stocks and see how often they are mentioned on twitter. I suppose there is actually only a very select set of stocks that get mentioned (tech stocks and other name brands). Is this predictive of performance? Do certain users have an outsized effect, such as E Musk or Trump (when he was president). Can you make a claim that this is rational information diffusion or something more like a speculative frenzy.", "17": "Sounds like you have a good question and a reasonable plan of analysis, but I would focus now on what kind of data you can get that will help to answer this question. Where are you getting data on house prices (this is not so hard, there are APIs like zillow or zoopla) and on transportation links (this is maybe slightly harder since each city might have its own data). I would encourage you to look at a date more fine grained than at the city level where transportation might have more to do with municipal structure and regional amenities rather that directly on economics. Could you get neighborhood level data in New York (or london) on house prices (the above APIs should work for this) and distance to different modes of transport. Can you look at changes in house prices as the result of newly constructed (or announced) projects such as cross rail (london) or 2nd ave subway extension (nyc). Then you could use a difference-in-difference model to look at similar neighborhoods without any additional transport links.", "18": "Interesting question. There is also a question as to the access to the internet, free or otherwise. Poorer countries will have worse internet access even without government censorship. How does wealth (GDP) and internet access correlate? What about internet freedom and other measures such as democracy or corruption indices? It would be good to look at changes in government policy and how this contributes to changes in economic outcomes, since this would have a more directly causal relationship. I know in the US there was a recent policy change moving away from net neutrality (a decrease in openness) and I am sure there are other such measures in other countries. The world bank has an API that you can use and that would help showcase some of the tools from the class.", "19": "It sounds like you have a good sense of how to acquire and analyze the data, but I would encourage you to broaden your question. How did a stock split affect TLSA price is essentially a one sentence answer: \\"it changed the value by x%.\\" A slightly more general question would allow for a more intricate analysis: for example, how do stock splits change company valuations. In some sense, it seems like it should be irrelevant since the method of selling shares has no intrinsic relation to the value of the company, however it seems empirically to matter. Perhaps you could look at many different companies that underwent a stock split and see how this affected the resulting valuation (market cap) of the company. Does this trend change over time? Does it depend on the industry or sector or other underlying economic\\u00a0factors? What precipitates a stock split?", "20": "This is a great question. It seems like you can get the requisite data and the project seems feasible. I would be interested also is seeing if there is a \\"popularity\\" effect or a \\"team\\" effect? Once you have your predicted price for each player, you can look for the most over and undervalued players and see if there is some obvious reason for this? Are they talked about a lot in the media or something (can you look at twitter mentions or something as a proxy). I do not know how the ultimate team works, but I assume that (video game) players can then use the purchased team to play against others. Do you have data on the outcome of these games? Do higher value players in fact make it more likely to win? You could construct a different notion of value that is how much a player adds to the likelihood of winning? Does the market value represent this instrumental value of making the team better?", "21": "Sounds like you have a solid tangible question and a reasonable approach to the data. We discussed before, and I stand by, the use of a difference-in-difference model. Towards this you should compare the change in FDI for other \\"control\\" countries---perhaps one in and one outside of the EU. It is also worth thinking about where the FDI is going/coming from. Is the composition of the flow changing even if the magnitude is not? Can you analyse by sector or industry? Has covid had a subsequent effect?", "22": "While you have a specific and tangible question, I worry that it might be too straightforward to yield any interesting analysis. For instance, what do you plan to say other than the correlation between the treasury rate and the NASDAQ index? Do you have a hypothesis as to why there is a relationship or what the mechanism is? Why the NASDAQ and not other exchanges? Is this a direct link between economic fundamentals or something to do with investor behavior or is it a target of the treasury? While these questions are more involved I am a bit at a loss as to how you would answer them? Perhaps if there is some literature on the subject you could follow that.", "23": "A very interesting question although a deep one so I imagine you will not settle it once and for all. It sounds like you have a solid plan for getting the data (note that world bank has an API you can use to showcase your skills from the semester). The main hurdle will be understanding what causes what: maybe people once wealth will want democracy seeing as their basic needs have been met, or maybe democracy itself causes the wealth. Can you find any example of exogenous change to political structure and see how this changes the economic trajectory (east v west germany is the obvious and well studied case, but I am sure there are more recent examples). What about corruption and theft even in obsentibly democratic countries? Are there other measures of freedom / democracy and how stable are these measures over time?", "24": "The data looks good, but I encourage you to hone in on a question. What information can you get from this data? Since you have the building address and zip code, you have a lot to work with: can you examine the effect of neighborhood designations on property values (how much difference is there is price just on one side or another of a municipal boundary) what about distance to a subway station or public park? Doing these things would require using additional data (like from google maps or similar) to understand the geospatial relation of the data. You can do some seriously cool visualizations with this kind of geospatial data.", "25": "The question is a fine one and it seems like you have a good avenue towards acquiring the requisite data (note that the world bank has an API you can use to show off some of your skills). The problem here is that both GDP and life expectancy will be highly correlated with many other things that might determine both (a la, omitted variable bias), for instance, literacy, quality of health care, education etc. Perhaps you could try to gather data on these various indicators and see which of them seem to be the most important in extending life. Also, what is it that is killing people in poor countries: child mortality? Infectious disease? Cancer? Can you try to figure out what are the areas to focus on if we want to improve life expectancy globally? Can you come up with a projection of how much that would cost? What are the countries with the largest improvements in the last 30 years? What have they done?", "26": "I do not have too much to add since we spoke about this project. It seems great: good data, cool question. It seems feasible and like the requisite data is structured and available.", "27": "This is a reasonable and tangible question and it seems like you have a good avenue towards acquiring the requisite data. The main limitation is that many of the drivers of economic inequality (corruption, opportunities for education, type of jobs available) might also be\\u00a0 the result of economic inequality, so that you have a \'chicken and egg\' problem. Perhaps a good methodology would be to look at *chages* in policy or circumstance that might affect income inequality and see that result of the change as compared to a control group that did not experience the\\u00a0 policy (this is broadly called a difference-in-difference framework). For example, did migration as the result of the Arab spring / Syrian civil war or changes in recent dramatic changes in oil prices have an effect on income inequality?", "28": "The question seems interesting if a little limited. The problem I see is that you might find a correlation between covid cases and bitcoin price (or a general increase over the last year) but then what? How can you claim the mechanism or reason for this relation? Is it just noise? Can you look at the price of bitcoin around the time when direct stimulus payments were made? In the US each taxpayer got $1800 dollars, many directly deposited on the same day? If there is a surge in the price or volume of trades on that day this is good evidence that it is the direct result of coronavirus. Can you look at which currencies are buying bitcoin (USD, GDP, etc) and how the national economy / covid / stimulus is in the country? Again this would push more towards a satisfying connection between the two variables. You need to think about where you will get this data if you have not already done so.", "29": "The question you ask is straightforward which has both positives and negatives. It seems feasible to gather the requisite data to examine the relationship between employment and growth. However, it is less clear exactly what you can say about this relation other than stating a correlation. I like the idea of trying to break down the relationship by looking at underlying factors such as literacy, although it is unclear if growth leads to literacy or the other way around? Perhaps honing your question slightly would help focus the entire project. China has some interesting features that might be worth exploring, such as extreme growth, rapid expansion of the middle class, and a movement towards economic liberalism: are these things also related to unemployment? In unemployment and growth evenly distributed throughout the country or concentrated in cities? Are employment figures accurate given a large informal economy (i.e., non-tax payers)? Have recent government policies had an effect on this relationship?", "30": "The question you ask is straightforward a has both positives and negatives. It seems feasible to gather the requisite data to examine the relationship but I am not convinced there is much to analyze here. You can show a correlation between two (or several) variables but then what? I encourage you to widen your view and try to use the data to investigate a more substantial question which will yield a more intricate analysis. Perhaps, trying to understand what are the underlying fundamentals that drive a common movement across all such currencies v. those that have an idiosyncratic effect. It is will known that publicity (such as high profile tweets) has a remarkable effect on bitcoin valuations. Can you leverage this? Are there more traditional economic indicators which predict (or correlate, explain, etc) the crypto valuations?", "31": "You have a solid tangible question and a reasonable approach to the data.\\u00a0 However, it might pay to think about a more intricate analysis. There is likely a strong correlation between corona virus rates and unemployment via obvious channels, so what else can you say besides a correlation coefficient? Can you analyse by sector or industry? Where is the driver of the new found unemployment? Is it regional by infection or uniform across national boundaries? Is is driven by demand shocks or government shutdown mandates? Does the rate seem responsive to lessening\\u00a0 numbers or is it here to stay?", "32": "I do not have too much to add in light of our prior discussion. The project seems like a good one, with an interesting and well motivated question and reasonably accessible data. I would try to use geographic data as a control in your diff-in-diff framework as this will let you see if the effect is really driven by the proximity to the outbreak. Neighboring countries could also act as controls.", "33": "I encourage you to craft a more intricate question that will yield a more substantial analysis. As it stands, the answer to your current question is a simple \'yes\' or \'no\'? What then? Perhaps, you could try to understand what are the underlying fundamentals that drive a common movement across all such currencies v. those that have an idiosyncratic effect. It is will known that publicity (such as high profile tweets) has a remarkable effect on bitcoin valuations. Can you leverage this? Are there more traditional economic indicators which predict (or correlate, explain, etc) the crypto valuations? If you want to account for risk you need to use a well defined measure of risk, and calculating this could be a good exercise. What does it mean for one asset to be riskier than another? What is the premium for risk? Doesn\'t this depend on investor preference and risk aversion? Are risk measure stable over time? Also, collecting the data via an API (yahoo, alpha vantage, coinbase https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2) would be a good way to showcase the skill we learned in class.", "34": "Great question and an important one. Seems like you have an in with the requisite data. Why Nitrogen tho? The queen diva of pollution at the moment is C02, can you get data on that? I would be interested also to see how fine grained the pollution data is---by city, country? Local pollution data could be matched with local infection rate data. Can you determine if changes in pollution are from a global slowdown reducing manufacturing and shipping or local effect of less cars, movement, electricity etc. It\'s likely both, but it would be brilliant to see a well throughout decomposition. How quickly does pollution respond, did it increase as numbers slowed? Did it increase locally or globally? Can you figure out which industries or sectors responded the most? Did the drop in oil prices offset the effect? What about plastic pollution for take out and gloves/masks/etc?", "35": "This is a great question. I encourage you, however, to try to construct a more individualized data set. Can you find measures of democracy, social connectivity, etc on your own, rather than relying on the single report as this would give you much more room to showcase your data acquisition and cleaning skills. Moreover, is it possible that different people report their happiness differently? Could it be that some cultures are unhappy but unwilling to admit it? Or happy but do not have a perspective? Perhaps a better method would be to look at changes in happiness for a given cultural over time. Then look at what changes across cultures lead to the largest intra-cultural increase in reported well being. Can you look at large scale external events (war, pandemic, etc) and see how this effects well being? Can you construct a price of happiness? If we wanted to make people better off, we would have to give them more education, freedom, etc (whatever you find is important to wellbeing) and how much would this cost to implement?", "36": "Seems like a good project but I caution you to examine the limits of the twitter API access early. It can be hard, if I recall correctly, to obtain tweets that are older than a few weeks. Other than that the question is clear and the data seems reasonable to acquire. Can you look at other high profile publicity of bitcoin, perhaps NYT or BBC stories on it, or tweets from other celebrity type figures? Perhaps also trying to understand what are the underlying fundamentals that drive a common movement across all such currencies v. those that have an idiosyncratic effect. Are there more traditional economic indicators which predict (or correlate, explain, etc) the crypto valuations?", "37": "A classic question. I would suggest looking more broadly not only at the UK since it is hard to tell what is going on with only one data point. There is of course a large endogeneity problem in that people want to migrate to countries with good economies: so do migrants make a good economy or does the good economy attract migrants? To get around this I encourage you to find some changes in migration policy (especially unforseen ones), such as Trump\'s travel ban, the refugees from the syrian war, or the new restrictions because of brexit. In these cases the change in migration is controlled by non economic factors making claims of causality a more realistic goal. You could also look at regions inside the UK where migrants end up, but you will have the same endogeneity problems. In this case, collecting the data would be the major hurdle and the statistical analysis would be a straightforward difference-in-difference model.", "38": "As discussed earlier, this seems like a good project. I think the question is straightforward and feasible. You should also construct control groups: when you see a change in the minimum wage see what happened in a similar region/city/country where there was no increase in the minimum wage That way it is more reasonable that the effect is really being driven by the cause and not by some other external\\u00a0factors. This is called a difference-in-difference model and is easy to implement with the tools from this class. Also, if there is a differential effect (sometime there is increased unemployment and sometimes not) what is the reason for this? What characteristics predict the effect of the policy change?", "39": "Great question. The data seems widely available and there are APIs for covid data and the world bank also has a nice API you can use. I would focus on trying to get the most fine grained infection rate data you can and then hone in on municipalities on the borders of different lockdown regimes. In other words, use a difference-in-difference framework to examine the effect of a lockdown by looking at towns or cities on different sides of a border and using the non-locked-down city as the control group. Visualizations and the like should come easily as you can plot time trends, demarcate the lockdown times, use geo-spatial plotting. Where are you going to get the lockdown data from? Is that easily available? You might need to be creative here or use webscraping if such a data set is not available.", "40": "Classic question. if you are are using world bank data, I suggest using the API as it allows you an opportunity to showcase your skills. I am a little rusty on my Macro, but I believe TFP is *defined* as a measure of growth (in other words the residuals in a regression\\u00a0 or model that is not explained by other variables) and therefore does not make sense as a proxy for human capital. I would instead construct your own measure of human capital such as university attendance, literacy, etc. There is also an heterogeneity problem in that countries that invest in human capital might grow faster but also counties with high growth (therefore wealth) might invest in human capital: a chicken and egg issue. Can you find policy changes that directly effected human capital accumulation, such as changes in tuition (the UK for example recently increased point source tuition from 3k to 9k per year), social programs for literacy, expansion of schooling, etc. Then use a difference-in-difference framework to estimate the effect of the policy change.", "41": "Classic question. If you are are using world bank data, I suggest using the API as it allows you an opportunity to showcase your skills.\\u00a0 There is also an heterogeneity problem in that countries that invest in education might grow faster but also counties with high growth (therefore wealth) might invest in education: a chicken and egg issue. Can you find policy changes that directly effected human capital accumulation, such as changes in tuition (the UK for example recently increased point source tuition from 3k to 9k per year). Then use a difference-in-difference framework to estimate the effect of the policy change. Working alone is totally fine. Can you see which areas of the economy are most effected by schooling? Does it create more inequality?", "42": "You have a solid tangible question and a reasonable approach to the data.\\u00a0 However, it might pay to think about a more intricate analysis. There is likely a strong correlation corona virus rates and stock prices, so what else can you say besides a correlation coefficient? Can you analyse by sector or industry? Where is the driver of the change? Is it regional by infection or uniform across national boundaries? Is is driven by demand shocks or government shutdown mandates?
